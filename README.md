# Admiral

Admiral is an advertisement delivery service that lets viewers control their ad-viewing experience without hurting content creators.

As an end user, you control how you see ads while still supporting your favorite sites.  Earn credit every time you see an ad, and use credit to block other ads.  It works on every browser with no need to install anything.  So for example, you can see a few extra ads on your PC, then enjoy an ad-free browsing experience on your phone.

As a content creator, simply paste in a line of code to start embedding Admiral ads in your website.  You'll earn more money than before while making your fans happier.  It's that simple.

As an advertiser, use Admiral like any other ad network.  Except that Admiral gives higher conversion rates while giving you more accurate data about viewers.  This is because users fill in personal information themselves(instead it having to be guessed by algorithms) and only see ads they're actually interested in.
